"""
The pdart.pds4 package contains classes representing various
structures used in PDS4.  Also included is a non-PDS4 structure, the
:class:`pdart.pds4.Archive`, which represents the set of all bundles
maintained by the PDART project.

**New to PDART?** This package contains mostly boilerplate code, none
of which is difficult to understand.
