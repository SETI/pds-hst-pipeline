"""
The :mod:`pdart.labels.` package contains the code to build the XML
needed for PDS4 labels.  This replaces the obsolete
:mod:`pdart.pds4labels` module which will be deleted.

**New to PDART?** This package makes heavy use of XML templating,
whose implementation is found in the :mod:`pdart.xml` package.  You
might want to become familiar with templating first.
